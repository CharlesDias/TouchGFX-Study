# TouchGFX Study

This is a repository to store some code created with TouchGFX to run on STM32H7B3I-DK and FK7B0M1-VBT6 V1.0 board. 

## Workshop2022Lab folder

That project code was created following the [STM32 Graphics Workshop](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/support/learning/stm32-education/stm32-moocs/STM32_Graphics_Workshop.html) provided by STMicroelectronics.

Hardware and Software:

* STM32H7B3I-DK board
* STM32CubeIDE 1.14.0
* STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32H7 V1.11.1
* TouchGFX Generator 4.23.0 
* TouchGFX Designer 4.23.0 

Final result after completing Lab 1 to Lab 5.
